## Question 1
Let's say that the interviewer asks you that the parking lot should assign a parking spot closest to the entrance. How do you go about solving this requirement?
### Answer
This requirement is more about how you implement this parking assignment strategy rather than designing it. The interviewer is really looking at your data structures and algorithms skills in this requirement. 

In this scenario, letâ€™s say we have four entrances and would like to return to the parking spot which is nearest to the entrance from where the customer is entering the parking lot. The best approach is to implement it using a **min-heap.**

- We will declare four min-heaps. We will add all parking spots to these min-heaps, so there will be a min-heap for each entrance. These min-heaps will store the parking spots in the order of the shortest distance from the entrance.

- We will also declare the following two sets of parking spots:
   - A set of available parking spots
   - A set of reserved parking spots


- We have a map of min-heaps where the key is the entrance ID, and the value is a min-heap. When the user calls the _`getParkingSpot`_ method, we get the entrance ID which gives us the min-heap for that entrance and allows us to pop the top element to get the parking spot. 

- We mark the parking spot as reserved and remove it from the available set. We also remove it from the min-heaps of other entrances.
